/**
Kotlin has introduced the concept of Data Class, whose main purpose is to simply hold data without the
boilerplate code needed in Java to create a POJO Class. Kotlinâ€™s solution enables us to avoid writing getters, setters,
equals, and hashCode methods, so it makes the model classes cleaner & more readable.
